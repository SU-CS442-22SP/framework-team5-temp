Code Search

Code search is a type of tools that allows analysis
and access to a specific code from a source channel.
The parameters for the code search can vary. A user
can enter the date of the code, the author, specific
language, a keyword, a library used(for some tools) or
most importantly a code snippet. Matching results will
be shown to the user and this can be used for
automation. This task helps developers in their
development and practice in various ways. A developer
can search for a code snippet to see how it is written,
which programs use it, and learn the source code of a
specific file/snippet in an efficient way. It speeds up
the software development process like no other
method can.

State Of Art

The state of the art for code automation is using
ML and various searching methods. Some search
methods include Neural Code Search, Semantic Search,
Graph Based Code Search.. Besides Machine Learning,
searching a database of repositories using semantic

search or structural search are the most used methods
to this day. These structures would be use to analyze
and find patterns and duplicate content.
